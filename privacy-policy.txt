Tumblr, Inc. ("Tumblr") takes the private nature of your personal
information very seriously. This Privacy Policy (which we adapted from a
policy originally provided by [Automattic] ([WordPress.com])) describes how we
treat the information we collect when you visit and use the website
available at Tumblr.com (the "Website") and is made available under the
Creative Commons Sharealike license. Please read this notice very carefully.

Website Visitors

  Like most website operators, Tumblr collects non-personally-identifying
  information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
  available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
  and the date and time of each visitor request. Tumblr’s purpose in
  collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
  how Tumblr’s visitors use its Website. From time to time, Tumblr may
  release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website.

  Tumblr also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Tumblr does not use such information to
  identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information,
  other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
  personally-identifying information, as described below.  

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

  Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with Tumblr in ways that
  require Tumblr to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
  type of information that Tumblr gathers depends on the nature of the
  interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
  Tumblr.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
  transactions with Tumblr are asked to provide additional information,
  including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
  process those transactions. In each case, Tumblr collects such information
  only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
  visitor’s interaction with Tumblr. Tumblr does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
  visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
  with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
  website-related activities.

  Tumblr does not collect personally identifiable information from children
  under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided Tumblr with
  personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her
  parent or guardian, please contact us at [support@tumblr.com] If Tumblr
  becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally
  identifiable information, we will delete such information. 

Aggregated Statistics

  Tumblr may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the
  Website. For instance, Tumblr may monitor the most popular blogs on the
  Tumblr.com site to help identify spam. Tumblr may display this information
  publicly or provide it to others. However, Tumblr does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below.  

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

  Tumblr discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
  contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
  information in order to process it on Tumblr’s behalf or to provide
  services available at the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
  disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
  organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the
  Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In
  addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types
  of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets
  that is transferred. Moreover, if Tumblr or substantially all of its assets
  were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Tumblr goes out of business or
  enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
  transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
  transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Tumblr may continue to use
  your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this
  policy. Otherwise, Tumblr will not rent or sell potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.

  Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as
  described above, Tumblr discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or
  when Tumblr believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
  to protect the property or rights of Tumblr, third parties or the public at
  large. If you are a registered user of the Tumblr Website and have supplied
  your email address, Tumblr may occasionally send you an email to tell you
  about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
  what’s going on with Tumblr and our products. We primarily use our various
  product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
  this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
  a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
  right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
  or to help us support other users. Tumblr takes all measures reasonably
  necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
  destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information.

  You should also be aware that if you submit information to "chat rooms,"
  "forums" or "message boards" such information becomes public information,
  meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to
  that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of
  receiving unwanted communications.

  For users outside the United States, please note that any
  personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be
  transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to
  such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you
  have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into
  the United States.

Links to Third Party Sites

  This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by Tumblr. This
  Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tumblr
  does not own or control, or employees that Tumblr does not manage. The
  Website contains links to third party websites. Any information you provide
  to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the
  privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such
  privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole
  responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable
  restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information,
  and Tumblr and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or
  disclosure of your personally-identifying information by any third party.

Security

  All non-personally-identifying information, potentially
  personally-identifying and personally identifying-information described
  above is stored on restricted database servers. 

Choice/Opt-out

  If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products, services
  or information that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with
  an e-mail address by which you may request no further notices. 

Cookies

  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
  computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
  the visitor returns. Tumblr uses cookies to help Tumblr identify and track
  visitors, their usage of the Tumblr Website, and their Website access
  preferences. Tumblr visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
  their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
  the Tumblr Website, with the drawback that certain features of Tumblr’s
  Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Address Book Data

  Any external address book data (email contacts, etc.) that a user
  voluntarily gives Tumblr access to will only be used for the described
  feature (looking up friends, etc.), and will not be stored or repurposed.

Privacy Policy Changes

  Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tumblr may change its Privacy
  Policy from time to time, and in Tumblr’s sole discretion. If we do then
  we’ll notify you by posting the amended policy on the Website or by
  emailing you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the
  modified document so that you can review it. In all cases, use of
  information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at
  the time such information is collected.

Review and Access

  Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we
  collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify
  or delete this information by sending an e-mail to [support@tumblr.com].
  Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion
  of your account.
