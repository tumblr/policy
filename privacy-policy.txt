ThinkUp LLC. ("ThinkUp", "we", "us", or "our") takes the private nature of your
personal information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy
practices (the "Privacy Policy") describes how we treat the information we
collect when you visit and use the website available at thinkup.com (the
"Site") and/or ThinkUp's other domains, products, services, and/or content
(collectively with the Site, the "Services"). When you use the Services, you
are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure
and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please
read it carefully.

What This Privacy Policy Covers

  This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you
  are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our
  treatment of any information that our partners share with us or that we
  share with our partners.

  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we
  do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party
  websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services") that you elect
  to access through the Service or to individuals that we don't manage or
  employ. While we try to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services
  that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for
  the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage
  you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you
  access.

What Information We Collect and How We Use It

  Account Information:

    When you create an account on a ThinkUp Service (an "Account"), you will
    provide information such as your username, password, and email address.
    You may also be required to provide us with your birthdate, which we use
    to verify your age and may use to personalize the Services for you (e.g.,
    by presenting you with content relevant to your age group). This
    information may personally identify you. For example, if you use your full
    name as your username, you are disclosing your identity to the public.

  Email Communications with Us:

    As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other
    communications from us, such as administrative communications relating to
    your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset).
    These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account,
    which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. You can opt-out of
    most communications from ThinkUp, such as insight notifications; please 
    see your Membership Settings page. Note that we will NEVER email you to 
    ask for your password or other Account information; if you receive such an
    email, forward it to us at help@thinkup.com.

    Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: You can link your
    Account to certain Third Party Services. In order to do so, you will
    provide us with your username or other user ID on each of those Third
    Party Services. You may also be required to engage in an authorization
    process with each of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token
    that allows us to access those accounts so that we can, for example, when
    you choose, post your ThinkUp content, or links to your ThinkUp content, to
    those services. We do not receive or store your passwords for your Third
    Party Service accounts.

  Information Obtained from Third Party Services:

    In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third
    Party Services, we may obtain information about you from those Third Party
    Services. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you
    have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available
    for ThinkUp to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use
    the information about you that we receive from Third Party Services to
    improve and personalize the Services. As a general practice, we strongly
    urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you
    disclose to Internet services, including ThinkUp and linked Third Party
    Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your accounts together.

  User Content:

    By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you
    provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it.
    Although we may provide tools, like privacy/security settings, that let you
    publish content privately, you should assume that anything you publish is
    publicly accessible unless you have explicitly selected otherwise. Content
    published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search
    engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that
    content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared
    throughout the Internet. While you are free to remove published pieces of 
    content from or delete your Account, because of the nature of Internet 
    sharing, copies of that content may exist elsewhere and be retained 
    indefinitely, including in our systems.

  Information About User Content:

    In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the
    Services. For example, when it's included with your images, we may collect
    information describing your camera and camera settings. This information
    allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and
    functionality.

  Financial Information:

    We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information
    related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration
    date or other financial information), for example when you decide to
    purchase a paid Service. We do not, however, store that financial
    information; such information is stored by our third party payment
    processor (the "Payment Processor"), and use and storage of that
    information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable [terms of
    service] and [privacy policy] (the Payment Processor may also have other
    terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself
    with those terms, as applicable). We do receive certain information from
    our Payment Processor: a unique token that we connect with your Account 
    to enable you to make further purchases using the information stored by 
    our Payment Processor.

  Information Related to Use of the Services:

    We collect information about how people use the Services, including those
    with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and
    may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors,
    which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on
    the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may
    also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics
    and Quantcast, to collect and analyze this information. This information
    enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often
    individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some
    of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined
    below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your
    Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you
    visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that
    is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not
    identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services
    to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.

  Information Related to Your Web Browser:

    We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when
    you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version,
    what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your
    language preference, the website or service that referred you to the
    Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen
    display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on
    your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether
    you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in
    a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is
    used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by
    personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not,
    however, used in a manner that would identify you personally.

  IP Address Information:

    Under certain circumstances, such as when you log into the Services or load
    a web page from the Services, we may collect and store your Internet 
    Protocol Address ("IP Address"). We generally use IP Address information to
    fight spam, malware, and identity theft; we also may use it, in the future,
    to personalize the Services for you. IP Address information is also used by
    us to generate aggregate, non-identifying, information about use of the 
    Services.

  Location Information:

    In some cases we collect and store information about where you are
    located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation, or
    by using location data stored in photos or in social media messages. We may 
    use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.

  Information Related to Your Mobile Device:

    We may collect and store information related to your mobile device, such
    as your phone number. You will have a choice as to whether we collect and
    store this information. We may use this information to improve the
    Services, such as by delivering notifications to your device if permitted.

  Information Collected Using Cookies:

    Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your web
    browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies
    in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your
    cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our
    servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the
    Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that
    personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information
    collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you
    are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and
    that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may
    associate that information with your Account if you have one. This
    information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on
    the Services, such as by presenting you with a different features when you
    are logged in to ThinkUp. Most web browsers have an option for turning off
    the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
    cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser
    software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a
    variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into 
    your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our
    Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using
    the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google 
    Analytics and Quantcast, may also place their own cookies on your browser.
    Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not
    cover the use of cookies by third parties.

  Information About Your Contacts:

    Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact
    lists stored on other services. We give you an explicit choice when you 
    provide us such information, and we will disclose fully, within the 
    appropriate feature, how we use, and whether we will store, that
    information.

  Derived Information:

    We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer
    characteristics that may be descriptive of you. These characteristics are
    used to improve and personalize the Services.

  Email Tracking:

    We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that
    allows us to measure our email deliverability, and we may track which
    links in an email are followed. We also use third-party email services
    such as MailChimp to deliver messages and you should review the policies
    of such services which govern these messages as well.

With Whom Your Information Is Shared

  We never share information we receive from you unless:

    (a) we have your permission to share that information;

    (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared,
        and with whom; or

    (c) that information is aggregate information or other information that
        does not identify you.

  Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:

    As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is
    shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services.
    Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to
    post on or submit to a connected service and anything apparent in a 
    posted photograph. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone
    and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search), you should be
    careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is 
    information you want to share with everyone.

  Information Shared Between the Services:

    We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple
    Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services
    operate, and to develop new Services.

  Information You Share with Third Party Services:

    You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by
    clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share
    information that you provide to us, with those Third Party Services (for
    example, by sharing insights to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy
    only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading 
    and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies.

  Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the
  Services:

    In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses)
    with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other
    agents ("Agents"), for the purposes of operating and improving the
    Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in
    order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to
    information in the process of improving our processes and technology.
    Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally
    bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently,
    our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other
    information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is
    necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal
    Information with our Agents.

  Information Shared with Third Parties:

    We may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information,
    or other non-Personal Information with people and entities that we do
    business with.

  Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:

    In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these
    transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred
    business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
    acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
    information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
    a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
    acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information
    as set forth in this policy.

  Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:

    We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try
    to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also
    reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we
    reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy
    any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental
    order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service],
    including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
    prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues
    (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations
    for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user
    support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of
    us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but
    not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or
    self-harm.

  Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:

    If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we
    will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.

The Security of Your Information

  Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and
  security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and
  Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately
  and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you
  have finished accessing your Account on the Services.

  We seek to protect your information (including your Account information) to
  ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of
  any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure,
  and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any
  time.

What Information You Can Access

  If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information
  associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your
  Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and
  delete cookies through their web browser settings.

How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account

  If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Membership
  page or by emailing us at help@thinkup.com and providing proof of authority

  on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying 
  information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting
  your Account may not fully or immediately remove the content you have 
  published from oursystems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or 
  references to your Account information may not be immediately removed. In 
  addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public a
  ctivity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers 
  and accessible to the public.
