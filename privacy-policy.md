ThinkUp LLC. takes the private nature of your
personal information very seriously. We respect your privacy and strive to use
your information in ways that you can understand, predict and control.

#### We'll use a few terms in this policy:

* "Privacy Policy": This policy regarding our privacy practices
* "ThinkUp", "we", "us", or "our": ThinkUp LLC
* "Site": ThinkUp.com
* Services: ThinkUp's other domains, products, services, and/or content, along
  with the Site

This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you
visit and use the Services. When you use the Services, you are consenting to 
the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of 
your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Because your privacy is important, we ask that you please read this Policy
carefully. We've also included higlighted annotations throughout this policy; 
these annotations aren't a part of the policy itself, but are intended to help 
you follow the text and to emphasize key sections.

### 1. Children

> "We do not collect personally identifiable information from children."

The Services are not directed towards, and ThinkUp does not knowingly collect 
information from, children under the age of 13. If you are a parent and 
believe your child under the age of thirteen (13) has created a Services 
account or otherwise provided personal information to ThinkUp, please 
contact us at help@thinkup.com.

### 2. What This Privacy Policy Covers

> "This Policy covers information you share with ThinkUp, not third parties."

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you
are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to 
the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but 
not limited to any third party websites, services and applications 
("Third Party Services") that you elect to access through the Service or to 
individuals that we don't manage or employ. We encourage you to carefully 
review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.

### 3. What Information We Collect and How We Use It

#### Account Information:

> "ThinkUp needs your account information like an email address and password."

When you create an account on a ThinkUp Service (an "Account"), you will
provide information such as your username, password, and email address.
You may also be required to provide us with your birthdate, which we use
to verify your age and may use to personalize the Services for you (e.g.,
by presenting you with content relevant to your age group). This
information may personally identify you. For example, if you use your full
name as your username, you are disclosing your identity to the public.

#### Email Communications with Us:

> "ThinkUp uses your email address to send necessary notifications."

As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other
communications from us, such as administrative communications relating to
your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset).
These communications are considered part of the Services and your Account,
which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. You can opt-out of
some communications from ThinkUp, such as insight notifications; please
see your Membership Settings page. Note that we will NEVER email you to
ask for your password or other Account information; if you receive such an
email, forward it to us at help@thinkup.com.

#### Information Obtained from Third Party Services:

> "ThinkUp uses your data shared from third-party networks like Twitter and 
Facebook, and you should understand their policies."

Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services: Key parts of the
Services require you to link your Account to certain third party social 
networking services, such as Twitter or Facebook ("Third Party Services"). 
In order to do so, you will provide your user ID and authentication on each 
of those Third Party Services, where we receive a token that allows us to 
access those accounts. We use this authorization as permission to, for 
example, retrieve your activity on those services.

We do NOT ask for, receive or store your passwords for your Third
Party Service accounts.

For your convenience, you can view the Twitter Terms of Service here:  
https://twitter.com/tos

And you can view the Twitter Privacy Policy here:  
https://twitter.com/privacy

Also for your convenience, you can view the Facebook Terms of Service:  
https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms

And you can view the Facebook Data Use Policy here:  
https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy

We STRONGLY encourage you to familiarize yourself with the terms of service
and privacy policy of any third-party services which you use in conjunction
with ThinkUp.

In some cases, when you connect your Account with your accounts on Third
Party Services, we may obtain information about you from those Third Party
Services. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you
have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available
for ThinkUp to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use
the information about you that we receive from Third Party Services to
improve and personalize the Services. As a general practice, we strongly
urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you
disclose to Internet services, including ThinkUp and linked Third Party
Services, regardless of whether you choose to link your accounts together.

#### User Content:

> "Your ThinkUp insights are public by default."

By default, the information we get from your accounts with Third Party 
Services and the anlysis generated by the Services regarding that 
information is public, and it is published so that anyone can view it. We 
provide tools, like privacy and security settings, that let you limit who 
can see information in your ThinkUp account. You should assume that 
anything ThinkUp publishes for you is publicly accessible unless you have 
explicitly selected otherwise. Content published and shared publicly is 
accessible to everyone, including search engines. In addition, information 
shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet. While you 
are free to remove published content from or delete your Account, because 
of the nature of Internet sharing, copies of that content may exist 
elsewhere and be retained indefinitely, including in our systems.

#### Information About User Content:

> "Your content might have data embedded in it. We may use that data."

In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the
Services. For example, when it's included with your images, we may collect
information describing your camera and camera settings, or when it is
included in your posts on Third Party Services, we may collect location
information. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide
additional features and functionality.

#### Financial Information:

> "Your payment details are stored at Amazon. You should read their policies."

We do not collect or store your financial information when you decide to
purchase a paid Service; instead, such information is stored by our third
party payment processor (the "Payment Processor"), and use and storage of
that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of
service and privacy policy (the Payment Processor may also have other
terms, and you are responsible for locating and familiarizing yourself
with those terms, as applicable). Currently, our Payment Processor is
Amazon Payments.

For your convenience, you can view the Privacy Policy for Amazon Payments
here:
https://payments.amazon.com/help?nodeId=82974

We do receive certain information from our Payment Processor: a unique
token that we connect with your Account to enable you to make further
purchases using the information stored by our Payment Processor.

#### Information Related to Use of the Services:

> "We use third party statistics and analytics services. Read their policies."

We collect information about how people use the Services, including those
with an Account. This information includes general usage information, and
may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors,
which pages or features of the Services they have visited, which links on
the Services they have clicked on, and the length of those visits. We may
also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics
and Chartbeat, to collect and analyze this information. This information
enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often
individuals use the Services so that we can analyze and improve them. Some
of this information may be associated with the IP Address (as defined
below) used to access the Services, and some may be associated with your
Account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you
visit. We may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that
is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not
identify you personally. We use information about your use of the Services
to improve and enhance your experience on the Services.

For your convenience, you may view the Google Analytics Terms of Service:  
http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html

And you can view the Google Analytics Privacy Policy:  
http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html

Also for your convenience, you may view the Chartbeat Terms of Service:  
https://chartbeat.com/terms/

And this is the Chartbeat Privacy Policy:  
https://chartbeat.com/privacy/

#### Information Related to Your Web Browser:

> "Web browsers typically send some data when you visit us; We use that to make
ThinkUp better."

We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when
you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version,
what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your
language preference, the website or service that referred you to the
Services, the date and time of each web request you make, your screen
display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on
your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether
you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in
a manner associated with your Account. Web browser-related information is
used to enhance your experience with the Services (for example, by
personalization) and to allow us to improve the Services; it is not,
however, used in a manner that would identify you personally.

#### IP Address Information:

> "Normally, when you visit ThinkUp we receive your IP address, which we'll use
to improve ThinkUp."

When you log into the Services or load a web page from the Services, we 
will collect and store your Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address"). We 
generally use IP Address information to fight spam, malware, and identity 
theft; we also may use it, in the future, to personalize the Services for 
you. IP Address information is also used by us to generate aggregate, 
non-identifying, information about use of the Services.

#### Location Information:

> "If we receive your location information, we'll use it to provide better
ThinkUp services to you."

In some cases we collect and store information about where you are
located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation, or
by using location data stored in photos or in social media messages. We may
use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you.

#### Information Collected Using Cookies:

> "We use cookies to make ThinkUp work for you. If you turn them off, you won't
be able to use ThinkUp. Some statistics services we use set cookies, too."

Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your web
browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies
in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your
cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our
servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the
Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that
personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information
collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you
are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and
that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and we may
associate that information with your Account if you have one. This
information, in turn, is sometimes used to personalize your experiences on
the Services, such as by presenting you with a different features when you
are logged in to ThinkUp. Most web browsers have an option for turning off
the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser
software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a
variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into
your Account, and so will not be able to use the vast majority of our
Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using
the Services. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google
Analytics and Chartbeat, may also place their own cookies on your browser.
Note that this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not
cover the use of cookies by third parties.

#### Information About Your Contacts:

> "ThinkUp automatically retrieves your friend or follower list from connected
services."

Certain features of the Services allow you to provide us with your contact
lists stored on other services. We only use and store that information to
provide the ThinkUp service to you.

#### Derived Information:

> "We may deduce information about you from your activity. We only do that
to provide the core ThinkUp services to you."

We analyze your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer
characteristics that may be descriptive of you. These characteristics are
used to improve and personalize the Services.

#### Email Tracking:

> "Sometimes we put a tracking link in emails to know if you opened an email
or clicked on a link in it."

We may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that
allows us to measure our email deliverability, and we may track which
links in an email are followed. We also use the third-party email services
MailChimp and Mandrill to deliver messages and you should review the 
policies of these services which govern these messages as well.

### 4. Remarketing

> “You may see more advertising for ThinkUp when you browse the web.”

We may use marketing services provided by Google and other third parties that 
allow us to deliver advertising to users after they leave our Services that 
they will see elsewhere on the web. This is a common practice called 
“remarketing.” Users will not see more ads than they otherwise would see as a 
result of remarketing; rather, the ads they see are more likely to be ads for 
ThinkUp products and services.  Google and any other third party marketing 
services providers we use to help us with remarketing use cookies as part of 
the remarketing service. For more information regarding remarketing and the 
ability to opt-out, please visit:

http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/
http://www.networkadvertising.org
http://www.aboutads.info

### 5. With Whom Your Information Is Shared

> "We don't share your personal information without telling you."

We never share information we receive from you unless:

(a) we have your permission to share that information;

(b) we have given you prior notice (such as within this privacy policy) 
that the information will be shared, and with whom; or

(c) that information is aggregate information or other information that
    does not identify you.

#### Information Shared with the Public Through the Services:

> "Your ThinkUp stream is public by default."

As noted above, by default, content published through the Services is
shared with the public, and this is an important feature of the Services.
Such information includes, but isn't limited to, anything you choose to
post on or submit to a connected service and anything apparent in a
posted photograph. Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone
and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search), you should be
careful in what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it is
information you want to share with everyone.

#### Information Shared Between the Services:

> "We might combine your use of different networks together to improve ThinkUp."

We may, if possible, aggregate information about your use of multiple
Services and use that consolidated information to improve how the Services
operate, and to develop new Services.

#### Information You Share with Third Party Services:

> "ThinkUp relies on your activity on third party networks to work."

You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by
clicking on externally-pointing links. You may also choose to share
information that you provide to us, with those Third Party Services (for
example, by sharing insights to Twitter or Facebook). This Privacy Policy
only governs information we collect and you are responsible for reading
and understanding those Third Party Services' privacy policies.

#### Information Shared with Our Agents in Order to Operate and Improve the Services:

> "If we hire a contractor or consultant, they'll follow the same policy here."

In some cases, we share information that we store (such as IP Addresses)
with third parties, such as our service providers, consultants and other
agents ("Agents"), for the purposes of operating and improving the
Services. For example, we may share information with service providers in
order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to
information in the process of improving our processes and technology.
Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally
bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently,
our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them 
beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us. You hereby 
consent to our sharing of your information with our Agents.

#### Information Shared with Third Parties:

> "If we share information with business partners, it would be aggregate
information."

We may share or disclose non-private information, information that is
aggregated with information relating to other Service user that does not
personally identify you, or other non-personally identifiable Information 
with people and entities that we do business with.

#### Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:

> "If we sell ThinkUp or its assets, all of your private information would come 
along in the sale."

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these
transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred
business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information
as set forth in this policy.

#### Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:

> "We will disclose information if needed to obey the law or to protect people."

We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try
to protect our community from baseless legal demands. That said, we also
reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we
reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy
any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental
order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service],
including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues
(including exchanging information with other companies and organizations
for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user
support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of
us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but
not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or
self-harm.

#### Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:

> "If you want to share your data, we'll accommodate you."

If you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we
will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.

### 6. The Security of Your Information

> "Keep your password safe. We're doing everything we can to keep your data safe."

Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and
security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and
Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately
and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you
have finished accessing your Account on the Services.

We use reasonable measures to protect your information (including your 
Account information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't 
guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, 
hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security 
of user information at any time.

### 7. What Information You Can Access

> "You can see your account information in your Settings page."

If you are a registered user, you can access and delete most information
associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your
Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and
delete cookies through their web browser settings.

Your California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections
1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice
identifying the categories of personal customer information that we share
with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and
providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If
you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please
submit a written request to the following address: 220 East 23rd Street,
Suite 601, New York NY 10010.

### 8. How to Delete Your Account and What Happens When You Delete Your Account

> "You can email us to cancel your account, and we'll delete your account. Some
information may persist for a while after your account is deleted."

If you want to delete your Account, you can do so from your Membership
page or by emailing us at help@thinkup.com and providing proof of authority
over the Account. What constitutes "proof of authority" will vary depending
on the circumstances, but generally will require sufficient identifying
information so that we can be confident you are the Account owner. Deleting
your Account may not fully or immediately remove the content you have
published from our systems, as caching of, backups of, copies of, or
references to your Account information may not be immediately removed. In
addition, given the nature of sharing on the Services, some of the public
activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers
and accessible to the public.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

> "We may change this privacy policy. If we do, we'll tell you."

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for
modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we
collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
information is used.

### Where to Direct Questions or Concerns

> "Seriously: If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, email us."

If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services,
please send us a detailed message to help@thinkup.com.

### Link to Prior Versions

> "You can see the changes we've made to this policy over time."
