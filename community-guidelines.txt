As a global platform for creativity and self-expression, Tumblr is deeply
committed to supporting and protecting freedom of speech. At the same time, we
draw lines around a few narrowly-defined but deeply important categories of
content and behavior that jeopardize our users, threaten our infrastructure,
or damage our community.

What Tumblr is for:

  Tumblr celebrates creativity. We want you to express yourself freely and use
  Tumblr to reflect who you are, and what you love, think, witness, and
  believe.

What Tumblr is not for:

  Malicious Bigotry.

    Don't actively promote violence or extreme hatred against individuals or
    groups, on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender,
    age, veteran status, or sexual orientation. While we firmly believe that
    the best response to hateful speech is not censorship but more speech, we
    will take down malicious bigotry, as defined here.

  Harm to Minors.

    Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a minor. Don't post anything
    relating to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Don't bully
    minors, even if you are one. Life as a teenager is hard enough without the
    fear, anguish, and isolation caused by online bullying.

  Promotion and Glorification of Self-Harm.

    Don't post content that actively promotes or glorifies self-harm. This
    includes content that urges or encourages readers to cut or injure
    themselves; embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or
    commit suicide rather than, e.g., seeking counseling or treatment, or
    joining together in supportive conversation with those suffering or
    recovering from depression or other conditions. Dialogue about these
    behaviors is incredibly important and online communities can be
    extraordinarily helpful to people struggling with these difficult
    conditions. We aim to sustain Tumblr as a place that facilitates
    awareness, support and recovery, and to remove only those blogs that cross
    the line into active promotion or glorification of self-harm.

  Gore and Mutilation Content.

    Don't post gore just to be shocking. Don't showcase the mutilation or
    torture of human beings, animals, or their remains.

  Unflagged NSFW Blogs.

    Tumblr is home to millions of readers and bloggers from a variety of
    locations, cultures, and backgrounds with different points of view
    concerning adult-oriented content. If you regularly post sexual or
    adult-oriented content, respect the choices of people in our community who
    would rather not see such content by flagging your blog (which you can do
    from the Settings page of each blog) as Not Suitable for Work ("NSFW").
    This action does not prevent you and your readers from using any of
    Tumblr's social features, but rather allows Tumblr users who don't want to
    see NSFW content to avoid seeing it.

  Uploading Sexually Explicit Videos.

    You can embed anything as long as it follows the other guidelines on this
    page. But please don't use Tumblr's Upload Video feature to host any
    sexually explicit videos. We're not in the business of profiting from
    adult-oriented videos and hosting this stuff is fucking expensive. You can
    use services like [xhamster.com] to host those instead.

  Non-Genuine Social Gesture Schemes.

    Don't participate in schemes to gain non-genuine gestures like follows or
    reblogs. Don't orchestrate or engage in "follow trains," where users are
    encouraged to follow lists of other users to gain more followers for
    themselves. Don't scatter deceptive links to your blog or Follow pages.
    Don't make bulk or indiscriminate use of messaging features like Fan Mail
    or Asks to bait followers.

  Username and URL Abuse.

    Tumblr's URLs (usernames) are for the use and enjoyment of our users.
    Don't squat, hoard, collect, trade, or sell Tumblr URLs, and don't
    register a URL for the purpose of impersonating an individual,
    organization, or brand.

  Spam.

    Don't abuse social gestures, send unwanted messages, or aggregate content
    in a less-than-meaningful way. Don't put tags on your posts that will
    mislead or deceive searchers (for example, tagging a photo of your car
    with "#lady gaga" and "#britney spears"); of course, meaningful uses are
    always fine (for example, ironic "punchline" tags that add to or playfully
    subvert a post itself). Don't put deceptive links or dubious code in your
    posts. That includes using Javascript to inject unwanted ads in blogs, or
    embedding links to interstitial or pop-up ad services. Don't use deceptive
    means to generate revenue or traffic, or create blogs with the primary
    purpose of affiliate marketing. Spam doesn't belong on Tumblr.

  Mass Registration and Automation.

    Don't register accounts or post content automatically, systematically, or
    programmatically.

  Unauthorized Contests, Sweepstakes, or Giveaways.

    Take a look at our [guidelines] for contests, sweepstakes, and giveaways,
    which are incorporated here by reference, for more information.

  Third-Party Theme Distribution.

    To manage the safety and stability of blog themes, the vast majority of
    which are contributed by the Tumblr community, it's important that themes
    are distributed through our centralized Theme Garden. Third-party theme
    directories are often used to inject nefarious code that results in spam,
    ads, or phishing attacks. Since anyone can host and promote their themes
    in the Theme Garden, don't create or use third-party services to
    distribute source code for Tumblr themes. Creating blogs or directories
    that curate themes in the Theme Garden is a-okay.

  Copyright and Trademark Infringement.

    Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others. If you aren't authorized
    to use someone else's copyrighted or trademarked work (either expressly or
    by legal exceptions and limitations like [fair use]), don't. It is our
    policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as per our
    [Terms of Service] and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

  Impersonation, Stalking, or Harassment.

    Treat the community the way you'd like to be treated. Don't attempt to
    circumvent the Block feature. If you want to parody or ridicule a public
    figure (and who doesn't?), don't try to trick readers into thinking you
    are actually that public figure.

  Privacy Violations.

    Don't use Tumblr to deceptively obtain personal information. Don't post
    content that violates anyone's privacy, including personally identifying
    or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security
    numbers, unlisted contact information, or private photos of your ex's junk
    (no matter how attractive).

  Disruptions, Exploits, and Resource Abuse.

    Our servers and the valiant engineers who support them work hard for you.
    Don't attempt unauthorized use, disruption, or exploitation of Tumblr.com
    or our other products and services, or otherwise abuse Tumblr's resources.

  Unlawful Uses and Content.

    This one's pretty obvious, but Tumblr is not a place for illegal behavior,
    including fraud, phishing, or illegally inciting violence.

And now, some words from our lawyers:

  If we conclude you are violating these policies, you may receive a notice
  via email. If you don't explain or correct your behavior, your account may
  be suspended and/or your IP address may be blocked. We do our best to ensure
  fair outcomes, but in all cases we reserve the right to suspend accounts or
  remove content, without notice, for any reason, but particularly to protect
  our services, infrastructure, users, or community. We reserve the right to
  enforce, or not enforce, these policies in our sole discretion, and these
  policies don't create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any
  particular manner.

  We also reserve the right to amend these policies using the procedures set
  forth in our [Terms of Service].

  If you have questions or feedback, don't hesitate to [let us know].
